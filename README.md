## üå± Getting Started 

If you're looking to contribute or actively develop on **PaiementPro for Give**, welcome! We're glad you're here. Please ‚≠êÔ∏è this repository and fork it to begin local development. 

Most of us are using [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com/) to develop on WordPress, which makes set up quick and easy. If you prefer [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV), or another flavor of local development that's cool too!

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as JavaScript engine
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) npm command globally available in CLI
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) composer command globally available in CLI

**Development Notes**

* Ensure that you have `SCRIPT_DEBUG` enabled within your wp-config.php file. Here's a good example of wp-config.php for debugging:
    ```
     // Enable WP_DEBUG mode
    define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
    
    // Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
    define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
   
    // Loads unminified core files
    define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
    ```
* Commit the `package.lock` file. Read more about why [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json). 
* Your editor should recognize the `.eslintrc` and `.editorconfig` files within the Repo's root directory. Please only submit PRs following those coding style rulesets.
